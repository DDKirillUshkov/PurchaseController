/**
 - important: Some notes about how requests are processed by SKPaymentQueue:
 - SKPaymentQueue is used to queue payments or restore purchases requests.
 - Payments are processed serially and in-order and require user interaction.
 - Restore purchases requests don't require user interaction and can jump ahead of the queue.
 - SKPaymentQueue rejects multiple restore purchases calls.
 - Having one payment queue observer for each request causes extra processing
 - Failed transactions only ever belong to queued payment requests.
 - restoreCompletedTransactionsFailedWithError is always called when a restore purchases request fails.
 - paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished is always called following 0 or more update transactions when a restore purchases request succeeds.
 - A complete transactions handler is require to catch any transactions that are updated when the app is not running.
 - Registering a complete transactions handler when the app launches ensures that any pending transactions can be cleared.
 - If a complete transactions handler is missing, pending transactions can be mis-attributed to any new incoming payments or restore purchases.
 
 The order in which transaction updates are processed is:
 1. payments (transactionState: .purchased and .failed for matching product identifiers)
 2. restore purchases (transactionState: .restored, or restoreCompletedTransactionsFailedWithError, or paymentQueueRestoreCompletedTransactionsFinished)
 3. complete transactions (transactionState: .purchased, .failed, .restored, .deferred)
 - Note:
 Any transactions where state == .purchasing are ignored.
